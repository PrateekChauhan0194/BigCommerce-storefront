# Methods

This directory will contain the method classes for each page in your
AUT (Application under test).

These classes contain the methods responsible for all the 
actions being performed and assertions being done on a webpage.

Keeping single responsibility principle in mind, each class would be 
responsible for the operations on it's corresponding page.
